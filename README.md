## Instructions

This is the classic game of matching two cards at a time until all cards have been matched.

Clicking any card in the deck will start the game timer but there isn't a time constraint on playing the game.
### Take as long as you want!!!

### **Pay Close Attention!!** 
When two cards have been clicked they will remain faceup for 1 second.
If they **MATCH** they will remain faceup, change background color and cannot be clicked again.
If they **DO NOT MATCH** the cards will turn facedown or present a blank card.

Once all the **MATCHES HAVE BEEN MADE** the game is over and a scoring block will appear.

You will have the option to either **PLAY AGAIN** which will reset the game, or **NO THANKS** which will exit the game. 

#Have Fun and Concentrate!
