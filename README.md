### Purpose of the Game 
The purpose of the game is purely for entertainment and to help develop memory skills. The origin of the game is not exactly known but is a favorite with young children and adults alike.

### Instructions

This is the classic game of matching two cards at a time until all cards have been matched.
Clicking any card in the deck will start the game timer but there isn't a time constraint on playing the game. 

**Take as long as you want!!!**  **Pay Close Attention!!** 

The game is about memory. When you click cards 2 cards clicked the moves counter will be incremented by 1 move. The more moves you take
to complete the game will decrease the number of stars you have.

Clicking one card at a time, click on two cards which will turn face up and remain that way for just under one (1) second. If they **DO NOT MATCH** they will turn face down again after the designated time delay.

If they **MATCH** they will remain faceup, change background color and cannot be clicked again.

Once all the **MATCHES HAVE BEEN MADE** the game is over and a scoring block will appear showing the number of moves you took. The star rating and the amount of time it took to match all the cards. The more stars you have after matching all the cards; the better your memory.

You will have the option to either **PLAY AGAIN** which will reset the game, or **NO THANKS** which will exit the game.
